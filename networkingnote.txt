        ipv6: 2a03:2880:f188:181:face:b00c:0:25de
        ipv4: 163.70.144.35


command used:
    nslookup-lookup the 1pv4 and ipv6 of an URL
	ipconfig-brings up your pcs ip coniguration
	
network address- A collection of many addresses 

----192.168.10.0/24----

{192.168.10 }Network ID      {.0}-host ID

subnet mask: conerting all the network bits to 1 and then converting it to decimal

router:-routes network traffic to destination
switches:- connects many devices to a single point using wires. 

access points:- access points work just like switches but wirelessly connecting multiple devices to a single point from where they can acccess the router

CISCO
copper straight through is for connecting a PC to a switch
copper straight through can also be used for connecting switches to routers
to connect router to router you must use serial dce(must add serial port to router if it is not available)


configuring routers
to configure a router open the CLI, answer no for inital configuration, 
get out of user mode(router>)
enter "enable" to enter privileded mode(router#)
type"show ip interface brief"




defalt gateway:
usually assigned the first ip of the network since it is importnant

in the subnet between the two routers the routers get assigned the first two ips of that network as the two default gateways



192.168.192.0/20


Vlan
confguring default gateways:
	go to router to split 1 gateway into 2 virtual gateways
	interface fe0/0.1
	encapsulation dot1q VLAN ID
	issue the default gateway address

VLSM

Switch configuration:
	enable
	show vlan brief
	conf t
	interface fe 0/1
	switchport mode accesss
	switchport acess vlan {VLanID}
	Creating Vlan:
		vlan (VlanID)
		name  (optional)
		
	Creating TrunkPorts:
		interface with port connecting your witch to the router
		switchport mode trunk

Routing:
	router rip
	network <network id>

dhcp:
	ip dhcp pool <name>
	network <network id><subnet mask>
	default-router <gateway address>
	ip dhcp excluded-address <gateway address>

Security:
	Connect laptop  using console cable
	conf t
	line console 0
	password <password>
	login
	exit 
	
	Applying another layer of security for admin mode:
		enable password <password>

	for modem access:
		conf t 
		line aux-0
		password <password>
		login
		exit
	Remote access config:
		conf t
		line vty 0 15
		password ciscovtypass
		login
		transport input telnet 
		exit

	remotely accessing the router through a laptop

		command prompt
		telnet (router address)
		then it should ask for password
redundancy(HSRP): 
	in the router
	
	int fa
	standby 1 ip <gateway address of that  network>
	standby 1 name <name>(optional)
	standby 1 priority 110
	standby 1 preempt

	int fa
	standby 1 ip <gateway address of that  network>
	standby 1 name <name>(optional)
	standby 1 priority 100
	standby 1 preempt


to hash passwords in MD5 
	service password encryption

Configuring ACL lists:
	ip access-list <standard/extended> <name> (standard for blocking networks, extended for just hosts)
	deny ip host <host address> <network address you wanna block the host from> <wild card mask> 
		(wild card mask is basically the reversed version of the subnet mask. easiest way to find the wild card mask is to just subtract 255 from all the octets 
		eg: subnet mask 255.255.255.248. the wildcard mask of this is 0.0.0.7 )
	permit ip any any (let all other ips except the blocked ones thru)

applying ACL list:
	interface <port no>
	ip access-group <ACL name> <in/out>  (in to apply the filter for incoming traffic. out to apply the filter for outgoing traffic)
